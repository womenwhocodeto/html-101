  Lastly,
  Add a class of "home" to your <main> element in the index.html page
  change its background-color to aliceblue.

  Try selecting the class yourself.
  Hint: Refer to the example above to determine how we target a class!
  Hint x2: Classes always start with a dot - (ex .gallery)
  Hint x3: We want to select the home class
